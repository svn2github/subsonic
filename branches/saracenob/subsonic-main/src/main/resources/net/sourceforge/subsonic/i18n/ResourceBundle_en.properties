  <p>Transcoding is the process of converting from one media format to another. {1}''s transcoding \
  engine allows for the streaming of media that would not otherwise be streamable. The transcoding is performed on-the-fly and doesn''t \

  <p>The actual transcoding is done by third-party command line programs which must be installed in {0}. \
  You may add your own custom transcoder given that it fulfills the following requirements: \
  <ul> \
  <li>It must have a command line interface.</li> \
  <li>It must be able to send output to stdout.</li> \
  <li>If used in step 2 it must be able to read input from stdin.</li> \
  </ul> \
